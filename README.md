# hello_world
Just testing my new powers\
Does this **nice little text field** support *MARKDOWN*? :3\
<font size = "8">
  What about HTML?\
</font>
Is this just like Jupyter?\
$f(x)=e^x$\
No, leider no LaTeX here. A tak hotelos'.\
Also no HTML, even though the text editor kinda tries to sublime it.
